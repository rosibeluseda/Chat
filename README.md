# Chat
A basic chat application built with Java that leverages network sockets to enable real-time communication. This application allows multiple users to connect to an online server, facilitating the exchange of messages in a shared chat room visible to all participants. The chat interface displays the status of each user, indicating whether they are idle, online, or offline. Additionally, it supports features such as login with own session and the ability to reconnect after disconnecting.
